
ANSWERS:


1.    int a;
      int b;
      int c;
      int p;
      int q;
      double r;
      The multiple variables declared and initalized on same line are split 
      and declared and initialized on seperate lines.
      The global variable z is converted to local variable. 
     
2.    Each operation is seperated on different line.
      Temporary variables are introduced for a  intermediate operation.

3.    Floats and doubles are represented using the scientific notations.
    

4.    Reads/writes to global variable z are performed by converting it to 
      local variable.A temporary is required for z=z+1 because it is a 
      mathematical operation whereas q=z is just a value assigned.
